In 2016 I began following a series of notebooks by Jake Vanderplas (JV) for the Astr599 course at the University of Washington originaly available at:

http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas/Astr599/notebooks/02_advanced_data_structures

In 2018 I returned to JVs notebooks and found that this website was no longer active. 
At that time JV was with the UW eScience Institute as Director of Open Software and the notebooks were available, and still are in 2024, on github:

    https://github.com/jakevdp/2014_fall_ASTR599/tree/master/notebooks

JV is now a software engineer with Google Research in Seattle and a developer of a number of open-source software projects.

As part of learning a bit about Git I'm going to revise the three notebooks I created as a result of carrying out some of the exercises in this course.
